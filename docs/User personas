Jim, 17

Jim just started a computing science course at uni. He knows a little about programming and these days he's trying to get his "hello world" programs working. In one of this lectures he's baffled by the concept of dictionaries in Python and the lecturer wasn't making it any easier to understand. 

Jim can go onto our website and search for the tags @python and @dictionary and a tag for his university course. He not only finds answers to his problem but also many other students have asked 
similar questions.

Dave, 22

Dave is a programming master who knows every single language from Python to COBOL. He's in his final year at university and wants to impart his wisdom onto future generations.

He can browse our website for programming tags e.g. @java and look for unanswered questions in which he can answer. Many students would appreciate it.

Troll

Troll is the personification of the typical Stack Overflow user who belittles other people's questions and offers unhelpful answers and thus making users feel bad about themselves.

Our website can monitor these users and take various measures such as moving these posts to the bottom of pages, deletion of these comments altogether by admins or removing these users altogether. We wouldn't anticipate many of these users would use our website (students only with .ac.uk emails) but our likes system also ensures the best posts/comments appear at the top
