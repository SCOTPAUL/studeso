STUDESO Overview
----------------

A Computer Science general discussion board and content aggregtor.


BASIC SPEC
----------
Users will be able to view questions/posts without an account.
If users want to comment or post their own content they require to register. However, they are able to post annoymously if they so wish.
Registering requires an ac.uk email address.

The post itself will be tagged, much like Twitter allowing for the post to be visible in different boards.
Tags use "@" symbol, followed by the name. [QUESTION] There is no limit on tags per question? [/QUESTION]
By default each post will use the user's username as a tag, however, this will not be displayed if user chooses to post annoymously.

Tags are used for searching relevant questions.
If a question is tagged @TagA, a second question is tagged @TagB and a third question is tagged: @TagA @TagB;
If user searches TagA 					- the first question would show up, the others wouldn't
If user searches TagB 					- the second question would show up, the others wouldn't
If user searches TagA/TagB OR TagB/TagA - the third question would show up, the others wouldn't

A special reserved 'all' tag can be used [QUESTION] by admins? [/QUESTION] to all posts to be spread on all tags
A special reserved 'admin' tag can be used to display important information on ALL or a specific tag.

Users can 'subscribe' to a tag which adds this to their homepage, when they sign in, so they get content that they are interested in

Each post will be able to be rated. This system will only work positively (Rated something if you found it helpful or you 'liked' the content)
