This is just a rough idea as to how we can present the app on Monday/Wednesday. We also need to consider any lack of CPU
time on PythonAnywhere or when it's uploaded to Leif's site.

Monday:

Duration: 6-7 minutes in room with Leif

What to focus on: 	- index page (i.e. what the user sees straight away)
			- login page (can briefly show registration page and explain email verification)
			- viewing posts,tags,demo of liking posts/following tags
			- searching content (explaining how it gets tags in post/content/titles)
			- from here we can go to show how a new post is added if nothing found
			- demo addition of tags, explain difference between user tags/institutuion tags/other tags,
			 and how sidebar changes
			- Ewan can demo help JSON functionality (if it works)



Wednesday (Lewis won't be there :( ):

Duration: about 3 minutes in lecture (needs to take care of main functionality due to time constraint)

What to focus on:	- index page
			- view posts
			- search
			- add post
			- tags

Really the same as Monday but need to keep it short and sweet!
